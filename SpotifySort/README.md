# SpotifySort

Tinder-style cleanup for your Spotify library and playlists. Built with SwiftUI, using PKCE auth, smooth preview playback, and a focused UI for fast decisions.

## ✨ Highlights
- SwiftUI app with thin Views and testable ViewModels
- Layered architecture (App → UI → Core), clear boundaries
- Smooth swipe deck with prefetching + back-pressure
- Preview playback with throttled waveform updates
- Pragmatic, incremental refactor plan (see below)
